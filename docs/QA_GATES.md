# QA Gates

This project uses layered quality gates in local verification and CI.

## Gate Layers

1. **Lint gate**
   - Command: `npm run lint`
   - Purpose: style and static correctness.

2. **Critical workflow regression gate**
   - Command: `npm run test:critical-workflows`
   - Scope:
     - Module access policy checks
     - Account/manager stock and finance helper logic
     - Core finance and API server regression tests

3. **Release gate**
   - Command: `node scripts/verify-complete.mjs`
   - Purpose: integrated release validation including build and e2e checks.

## CI Workflow

Defined in [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml), in this order:

- Install dependencies
- Lint
- Critical workflow regression suite
- Install Playwright browser
- Release gate

## Local Recommendation Before Merge

1. `npm run lint`
2. `npm run test:critical-workflows`
